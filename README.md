Mini-project for the 2019-2020 Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems Course in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

Composed of several simple agents that perform tasks.

Excerpt from problem definition:

>Consider that our agents have a working autonomy of n steps.
>
>During a cycle of n steps, agents perform tasks and perceive the utilities resulting from their work in order to
>form beliefs regarding the expected utility of each task.
>
>Once a cycle ends, agents are recharged and erase their memory in order to renew beliefs for the next cycle.

Examples and running procedures are defined in the Exercise file "ExerciseAAMAS 2020 v1_1.pdf"
